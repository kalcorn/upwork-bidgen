• Regulatory Expertise – SOX, FINRA, and PCI compliance built into every solution
• Risk-Aware Architecture – Fault-tolerant systems designed for financial data integrity
• Audit-Ready Documentation – Complete trails for regulatory reviews and compliance audits
• Performance Under Pressure – High-frequency trading and real-time processing experience

💻 Technical Expertise:
• Node.js, TypeScript, React, Angular, Java, C#, PHP
