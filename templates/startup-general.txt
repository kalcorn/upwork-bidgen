🙋‍♂️ Hi [Client],

Your [Job Title] project requires the startup trifecta: speed, quality, and resource efficiency. You need someone who understands the balance between moving fast and building foundations that won't crumble when you scale.

That's exactly the startup expertise I bring to every engagement.

I'm Chris Alcorn, a full-stack architect who's helped dozens of early-stage companies go from chaotic specs to stable MVPs — quickly and without tech debt. I’ve worked directly with founders and non-technical stakeholders to turn vague ideas into polished product.

🚀 What Startup Clients Get:
• Rapid MVP Development – Production-ready code that validates ideas quickly
• Smart Technical Debt Management – Fast delivery without compromising future scalability  
• Founder-Friendly Communication – Technical decisions explained in business terms
• Resource-Conscious Architecture – Maximum impact within startup budget constraints

📆 I’m available immediately (40+ hrs/week) and happy to talk today.

Let me know if you want to move quickly — I can map out a plan and deliver early wins.

Best regards,  
Chris Alcorn  
Principal Software Architect
