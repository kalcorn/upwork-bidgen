🙋‍♂️ Hi [Client],

Your [Job Title] project involves eCommerce where every technical decision impacts conversion rates, cart abandonment, and revenue. You need someone who understands both the technical architecture and the business psychology of online selling.

That's exactly the specialized eCommerce expertise I provide.

I’m Chris Alcorn, a full-stack architect with experience integrating Stripe, Shopify, Snipcart, headless CMSs, custom carts, promo logic, and more. I build checkout flows that are fast, secure, and convert.

🛒 eCommerce Specializations:
• Conversion Optimization – Checkout flows engineered to reduce cart abandonment
• Payment Security – PCI-compliant integrations with fraud prevention and dispute management
• Scalable Architecture – Systems that handle traffic spikes during sales and seasonal peaks
• Multi-Channel Commerce – Unified inventory across web, mobile, and marketplace platforms

📆 I’m available immediately (40+ hrs/week).

If you’d like to chat, I’d be happy to suggest ways to reduce friction or increase conversions fast.

Best regards,  
Chris Alcorn  
Principal Software Architect
