🙋‍♂️ Hi [Client],

Your [Job Title] project involves telecommunications infrastructure where reliability, latency, and compliance are non-negotiable requirements. This is precisely the specialized domain I've focused my career on.

I’ve designed and deployed telephony systems handling millions of calls/messages using Twilio, Telnyx, SignalWire, and Asterisk. Whether it’s voice routing, SIP trunking, multi-channel SMS, or fax fallback — I’ve built it before and can do it again with minimal ramp-up.

✅ Telecommunications Expertise:
• Enterprise-Grade VoIP – Scalable systems with 99.9% uptime and automatic failover
• Compliance Ready – STIR/SHAKEN, TCPA, and carrier regulations built-in
• Performance Optimized – Sub-100ms latency routing with real-time monitoring
• Multi-Channel Integration – Voice, SMS, MMS, and fax unified in single platforms

📆 I’m available now (40+ hrs/week) and can deliver results quickly.

Happy to review your architecture or jump in immediately.

Best regards,  
Chris Alcorn
