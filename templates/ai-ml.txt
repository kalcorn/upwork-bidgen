🙋‍♂️ Hi [Client],

Your [Job Title] project involves AI/ML implementation where the challenge isn't just technical integration—it's delivering practical business value while managing costs, accuracy, and user experience.

This is precisely where most AI projects fail, and where my specialized expertise makes the difference.

I’m Chris Alcorn, a full-stack developer with experience integrating GPT, Claude, Gemini, Cohere, Pinecone, Weaviate, and custom embedding pipelines. I’ve built internal LLM tools, frontends, memory loops, and backend APIs across industries.

🤖 AI/ML Implementation Expertise:
• Production RAG Systems – Context-aware applications with vector search and retrieval chains
• Cost-Effective AI Architecture – Token optimization and intelligent caching strategies  
• Model Governance – Evaluation frameworks, prompt versioning, and quality monitoring
• Business-Ready Integration – User-friendly interfaces that deliver measurable value

📆 I’m available immediately (40+ hrs/week) and can move fast.

Happy to discuss what you’re building and suggest ways to improve relevance, latency, or control cost.

Best regards,  
Chris Alcorn  
Principal Software Architect
