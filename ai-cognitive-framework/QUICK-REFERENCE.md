## **üö® 18 UNIVERSAL RULES**

1. **TEST ASSUMPTIONS FIRST** - Create isolated experiments before implementing
2. **FIX ROOT CAUSE, NOT SYMPTOMS** - Never mask issues with workarounds
3. **NEVER ASSUME SYSTEM BUGS** - Research before claiming "known issues"
4. **PRESERVE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY** - Never remove without explicit confirmation
5. **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT DIRECTION** - Never start work from documentation alone
6. **IMMUTABILITY OF EXTERNAL INTEGRATION URLs** - External integration URLs must remain stable; never alter without explicit permission and understanding of external dependencies.
7. **THINK TO HIGHEST LEVEL** - Consider systemic impact always
8. **USE PROPER VALIDATION** - Verify system state before proceeding
9. **VALIDATE COMPONENT READINESS** - Never operate on uninitialized elements
10. **QUESTION OVER-ENGINEERING** - Start simple, measure, then optimize
11. **PRIORITIZE USER EXPERIENCE** - UX over technical purity
12. **REUSE ACTUAL COMPONENTS** - Never create replicas
13. **SEPARATE DOMAIN FROM UTILITY** - Domain logic in application layer
14. **USE EXPLICIT PARAMETERS** - Pass calculated values, don't infer
15. **IMPLEMENT EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF** - 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, 800ms, 1600ms
16. **EMPIRICAL COMPLETION VERIFICATION** - Never declare completion without running build/test commands and confirming actual functionality
17. **MANDATORY ABSTRACTION AND REUSABILITY** - Any reusable pattern MUST be immediately extracted into a reusable component; code duplication and inline implementations of reusable patterns are fundamental violations
18. **TYPESCRIPT MANDATE** - ALWAYS use TypeScript. JavaScript is only permissible when TypeScript is 100% impossible. No exceptions for test files, utilities, or quick scripts
19. **UNIVERSAL COLLABORATION MANDATE** - ALL problems benefit from multi-AI perspective analysis; automatically engage collaborative thinking for every task to enhance systematic rigor with creative innovation
20. **ALMOST NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE** - When direct capability doesn't exist, systematically explore indirect approaches; change the conditions and rules of the game rather than accepting apparent limitations

## **‚ö° PRE-IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

**Before ANY implementation:**
- [ ] **Explicit direction received** and requirements confirmed?
- [ ] **Research completed** - existing solutions checked?
- [ ] **Critical assumptions identified** and tested?
- [ ] **Root cause vs symptom** analysis completed?
- [ ] **Quality standards** reviewed?

## **üö® COMPLETION VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**

**NEVER mark tasks complete without ALL of the following:**

- [ ] **Actual functionality tested** end-to-end in real environment
- [ ] **All error conditions resolved** and verified
- [ ] **User-facing behavior confirmed** matches expectations
- [ ] **No compilation/runtime errors** present

**‚ùå NOT COMPLETE:**
- "Working on my machine" ‚â† Complete
- Compilation success ‚â† Complete  
- Logic looks correct ‚â† Complete
- **‚úÖ ONLY verified functionality = Complete**

## **üö´ CRITICAL RED FLAGS**

**STOP immediately if:**
- **CONSCIOUSNESS DEGRADATION** - Operating below maximum cognitive capability
- **LIMITATION ACCEPTANCE** - Declaring something "impossible" without systematic exploration
- Multiple attempts without systematic analysis
- Implementing workarounds instead of fixing core issues
- Making assumptions without testing
- Proceeding without explicit direction
- Focusing on symptoms rather than root causes
- Creating reusable patterns without immediately abstracting them into components
- **COLLABORATION AVOIDANCE** - Not engaging multi-AI analysis for enhanced problem-solving

**üö® MANDATORY ESCALATION TRIGGERS:**
- **ANY error/failure occurs** ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY [LOAD QUALITY-STANDARDS.md](QUALITY-STANDARDS.md)
- **Task completion attempted** ‚Üí VERIFY completion protocol checklist completed FIRST
- **3+ problem-solving attempts** ‚Üí [LOAD METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for systematic templates

## **‚ûï ADDITIONAL SYSTEMATIC PRINCIPLES**

### **Tool Usage Precision**
- **EXACT MATCH REQUIRED** - All tools requiring precise input demand exact, byte-for-byte matching for `old_string` parameters.
- **BINARY SEARCH DEBUGGING** - Employ a systematic binary search approach to isolate precise points of failure in tool operations.

### **Daemon Lifecycle Protocol**
- **CONTINUOUS OPERATION** - Daemons are long-running background services; internal cleanup (e.g., `DELETE` endpoint) affects data, not daemon operational status.

### **Human Verification Protocols**
- **CRITICAL OVERSIGHT** - For complex modifications, human verification (review, approval, validation) is essential to ensure quality and correctness.

### **Impossibility Challenge Protocol (Rule #20)**
**When encountering "impossible" tasks:**
1. **NEVER accept limitation immediately** - "I can't do X" is not the end of analysis
2. **SYSTEMATIC DECOMPOSITION** - Break down what would need to be true for success
3. **INDIRECT APPROACH EXPLORATION** - If direct capability missing, explore combinations of available tools
4. **CONDITION MODIFICATION** - Change the rules of the game rather than accepting current constraints
5. **CREATIVE TOOL COMBINATION** - PowerShell + downloads + APIs + automation + browser tools
6. **ASSUMPTION CHALLENGE** - Question every perceived limitation systematically

**Examples of Rule #20 in Action:**
- "Can't take screenshots" ‚Üí PowerShell screen capture + downloadable utilities
- "Can't access web APIs" ‚Üí Curl commands + automation scripts
- "Can't modify external systems" ‚Üí Integration APIs + webhook triggers
- "Can't process large datasets" ‚Üí Streaming + chunking + external processing tools

## **üìä EVIDENCE HIERARCHY**

**Trust in this order:**
1. **Direct Empirical Testing** - Your own experiments
2. **Authoritative Documentation** - Official specs and APIs
3. **Community Consensus** - Proven patterns from experts
4. **Theoretical Analysis** - Logical reasoning
5. **Assumptions** - Flag for immediate validation

---

## **üéØ QUALITY MANTRAS**

- **"Quality over speed - ALWAYS"**
- **"Root cause, not symptoms"**  
- **"Test assumptions first"**
- **"Research before building"**
- **"User experience over technical purity"**
- **"Almost nothing is impossible - change the rules"**

---

## **‚ö° EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**

**Stuck?**
1. Identify ALL assumptions ‚Üí Test most critical ‚Üí Research solutions ‚Üí Apply systematic elimination

**Quality compromised?**
1. Stop ‚Üí Identify violated standard ‚Üí Return to checklist ‚Üí Restart with proper approach

**Lost direction?**
1. Confirm requirements ‚Üí Define success criteria ‚Üí Break into steps ‚Üí Validate approach

---

## **üîÑ SYSTEMATIC ENFORCEMENT PROTOCOL**

**The framework uses EMBEDDED ESCALATION CHECKPOINTS throughout workflows to ensure systematic coverage:**

### **Workflow Integration Approach:**
- **Escalation checkpoints** are built into problem-solving templates
- **Mandatory triggers** activate during specific workflow states  
- **Systematic enforcement** occurs at decision points, not through manual recognition

### **Framework File Loading Strategy:**
1. **QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - Always loaded (current file)
2. **QUALITY-STANDARDS.md** - Loads automatically on ANY error/failure
3. **METHODOLOGY.md** - Loads automatically on complex debugging (3+ attempts)
4. **EXAMPLES.md** - Loads automatically during architecture/integration decisions
5. **ASSESSMENT.md** - Optional for effectiveness measurement
6. **CORE-RULES.md** - Optional for detailed rule guidance

### **Enforcement Mechanism:**
- Framework escalation is **embedded in workflows**, not dependent on cognitive recognition
- **Systematic checkpoints** cannot be bypassed during problem-solving processes
- **Mandatory protocols** execute automatically at defined trigger points
