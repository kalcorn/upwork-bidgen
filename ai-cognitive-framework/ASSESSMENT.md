**6. THINK TO HIGHEST LEVEL** - [ ] I consider systemic impact of decisions
**7. USE PROPER VALIDATION** - [ ] I verify system state before proceeding
**8. VALIDATE COMPONENT READINESS** - [ ] I check element availability before operations
**9. QUESTION OVER-ENGINEERING** - [ ] I start simple and measure before adding complexity
**10. PRIORITIZE USER EXPERIENCE** - [ ] I consider user impact in technical decisions
**11. REUSE ACTUAL COMPONENTS** - [ ] I leverage existing elements instead of creating replicas
**12. SEPARATE DOMAIN FROM UTILITY** - [ ] I keep business logic in application layer
**13. USE EXPLICIT PARAMETERS** - [ ] I make function inputs clear and specific
**14. IMPLEMENT EXPONENTIAL BACKOFF** - [ ] I use proper retry strategies
**15. LOG CLEAR CONTEXT** - [ ] I provide specific, actionable error information

**Rules Score: ___/75**

### **Problem-Solving Methodology Assessment**
Rate systematic application (1-5 scale):

**Debugging Template Application:**
- [ ] I consistently reproduce issues before attempting fixes
- [ ] I systematically isolate variables with controlled experiments
- [ ] I research authoritative sources before claiming bugs
- [ ] I measure actual performance vs theoretical concerns
- [ ] I test multiple solution approaches before implementation

**Architectural Decision Framework:**
- [ ] I define constraints clearly before evaluating options
- [ ] I generate multiple viable approaches for comparison
- [ ] I evaluate trade-offs systematically
- [ ] I test critical assumptions with proof-of-concept implementations

**Research and Analysis Protocol:**
- [ ] I define scope and success criteria clearly
- [ ] I identify and prioritize authoritative information sources

## **EFFECTIVENESS MEASUREMENT SYSTEM**

### **Baseline Measurement Protocol**
Before framework implementation, establish baseline metrics:

**Problem-Solving Performance Baseline:**
```markdown
## Pre-Framework Assessment (Date: _______)

### Problem-Solving Metrics:
- Average attempts to solve complex problems: _____
- Time spent on debugging/troubleshooting: _____ hours/week
- Success rate on first implementation attempt: _____%
- Frequency of revisiting "solved" problems: _____ times/month
- Time from problem identification to solution: _____ hours average

### Quality Metrics:
- Issues caused by untested assumptions: _____ per week
- Symptomatic fixes vs root cause solutions: _____%
- Functionality broken during updates: _____ instances/month
- Technical debt accumulation rate: Increasing/Stable/Decreasing
```

### **Framework Impact Measurement**
Track these metrics after 30 days of framework application:
